## Original README from kasper
completly based on the forum https://community.theta360.guide/t/ricoh-blog-post-running-opencv-in-your-ricoh-theta/4084 by roohii_3 so not my own work.

Main adjustment was in the sample.cpp file I had to change "Java_com_theta360_opencvsample_MainActivity_version"  to "Java_com_example_opencvsample_MainActivity_version". To make ik work.

## Additional Notes from theta360.guide community

Tested with OpenCV 3.4.5

You need OpenCV in addition to this repo.
